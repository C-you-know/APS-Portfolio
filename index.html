        <h2>About Myself</h2>
        <h3>
            Hello, people of the internet! My name is Chinmay. I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence at KLE Technological University, Hubballi. 
            I'm deeply passionate about systemsâ€”understanding them as an interconnected network of subsystems. This fascination with interactions and modeling complex systems is what drives me, and I believe it makes me a strong fit for McKinsey.         
            I'm detail-oriented and obsessed with crafting efficient solutions that actually work. I am excited to work in multiple domains and I can test my inner polymath!
        </h3>
