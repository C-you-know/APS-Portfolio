        <p>
            Hello, people of the internet! My name is Chinmay. I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence at KLE Technological University, Hubballi. 
            I'm deeply passionate about systems—understanding them as an interconnected network of subsystems. This fascination with interactions and modeling complex systems is what drives me, and I believe it makes me a strong fit for McKinsey.         
            I'm detail-oriented and obsessed with crafting efficient solutions that actually work. I am excited to work in multiple domains and I can test my inner polymath!

        <p>
            McKinsey is one of the Big Four consulting firms. It advises clients ranging from Fortune 500 companies to world governments and international organizations like the United Nations. 
        
            At its core, McKinsey's work is about researching and understanding the needs of systems—whether they involve people, processes, or machines. It is a high-impact company, operating globally and engaging across virtually every domain, from healthcare to space technologies.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Many CEOs of major companies have either worked or interned at McKinsey!
            
            <br><br>
            This has been my dream company since 12th grade, and I would absolutely love the opportunity to work and grow at this incredible firm.
